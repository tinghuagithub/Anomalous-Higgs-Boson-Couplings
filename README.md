# Anomalous-Higgs-boson-Couplings
This is the repository that contains the source code for anomalous Higgs boson couplings and the input cards used to generate matching and merging events. 
VBFNLO contains source code for VBFNLO with implementation of anomalous Higgs boson couplings.
Analysis/ contains the Rivet analysis used in the thesis.
Results/Yoda contains the yoda file for the SM, CP-even, CP-odd, and CP-mixed.
