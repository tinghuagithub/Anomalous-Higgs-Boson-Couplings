2014-04-15 *** Changes in Version 2.7.0

  *** Major enhancements (for details see manual): ***

        * Several new processes are available:
          Wgammajj in VBF, HHjj in VBF, W, Wj, WH, WHj, pp->Spin2jj in VBF (with 
          Spin2->WW/ZZ->leptons), several QCD induced processes (WZjj, Wgammajj, same sign 
          WWjj, Wjj)
          Anomalous gauge boson couplings are supported in VBF Wgammajj, WH, WHj.
        * Semileptonic decay modes are available in the following diboson, triboson and 
          VBF diboson plus two jets processes: VV, VVV, VVgamma, VVjj with V=W,Z.
          Additionally, the Higgs production processes pp -> H -> WW/ZZ in VBF
          with semileptonic decays are available as well.
          The processes with semileptonic decays support anomalous gauge boson couplings.
        * The VBF VVjj processes can be run taking a second Higgs resonance into account
          (simplified 2HDM).
        * Anomalous gauge boson couplings are now available in all triboson (plus jet)
          processes and all VVjj production processes via VBF.
        * A larger set of operators leading to anomalous gauge boson couplings 
          is included in VBFNLO.
        * Added ability to use anomalous HVV couplings in Higgs production via
          gluon fusion, where the Higgs decays into WW or ZZ (prodIDs 4105-7)

  ***  Further updates and new features: ***

        * It is now possible to specify a desired number of unweighted events for event
          output in vbfnlo.dat
          In case VBFNLO is not able to achieve the desired number of unweighted
          events due to single events with very large weights it's also possible to
          opt for "partially unweighted events", where most of the weights will have
          weight 1, and a few will have larger weights.
        * Added 'any leptons' switch (LEPTONS = 98/99), allowing for all possible lepton
          final state combinations of 2 or 3 generations.  See manual for details.
        * m_ll cut can be switched between cutting only opposite-sign lepton combinations
          or all combinations
        * H->bb decay mode for Higgs boson production processes:
          jet cuts are applied to final state b-quarks
        * All default values of anomalous couplings are set to zero
          to avoid confusion
        * implemented staggered pT cuts for leptons and photons

          several VBF, di- and triboson processes

        * Several dynamical renormalization and factorization scale choices corrected which 
          gave wrong results for the real emission part of NLO calculations:
          min(pT_jet) (ID 2), min(ET_bosons) (ID 7)
        * fix particle-antiparticle-assignment in W+jj, Zjj
