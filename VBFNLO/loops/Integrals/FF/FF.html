<h1>FF</h1>
<h3>A library for evaluating one-loop integrals</h3>
<p>
FF is a library to evaluate one-loop integrals needed for radiative 
corrections to scattering processes in particle physics.  The idea of 
such a library is based on FormF by M. Veltman.  Unfortunately this 
only runs in CDC and 68000 assembler,  
and uses very high precision (more than 100 digits) to overcome the numerical 
instabilities that plague these integrals.  FF uses alternative algorithms 
which run in double precision Fortran 77.  It is available by anonymous ftp. 

<p>The current version includes
<ul>
<li>The scalar one- to sixpoint functions A0 to F0 for real masses
<li>Vector functions (using the Passarino-Veltman reduction scheme),
some derived from Andre Aeppli's routines, up to B2,D3,E3,F3
<li>The A0 to C0 for general complex masses, D0 to F0 in the pole scheme only.
</ul>
The user interface is described the manual, which is included in the 
distribution.  The main point to notice is that the routines check their 
precision by increasing a parameter <b>ier</b>, which should be set to the 
number of unreliable digits before calling an ff-routine.  One usually 
ends up with code like:
<pre>
      ier = 0     ! all digits are OK
      id = 3001   ! my threepoint function (optional, choose anything)
      call ffxc0(cc0,xpi,ier)
      if ( ier.gt.10 ) call ffwarn(998,ier,x0,x0) 
                  ! print out why the answer is so bad
</pre>
There is a coupler to C, C++ and Mathematica available from W&uuml;rzburg, <a 
href="ftp://ftp.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pub/hep/LoopTools.html">LoopTools</a>, 
this also computes the tensor reduction in their convention.
