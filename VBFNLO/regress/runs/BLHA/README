BLHA example files 
==================

Herwig
--------
Three example files for different VBF processes are currently available
for the Herwig 7 & VBFNLO 3.0 setup:

* 100_Hjj_Herwig_ShowerHadron:
VBF-H production at NLO QCD including parton shower using the MC@NLO
matching scheme with the default, angular-ordered shower and including
Higgs decays and hadronization. 
Higgs branching fractions into the various final states correspond to
the SM-Higgs expectation.

* 220_WpZljj_Herwig_NLOevents
VBF production of e+ nu_e mu+ mu- jj (W+Zjj) at NLO QCD.
This is an example how to write out NLO event files. 
The produced event file will get rather large (~3GB), so reduce the
number of points first if you are low on disk space.

* 250_WpWpjj_Herwig_anomK
VBF production e+ nu_e mu+ mu- jj (W+W+jj) at NLO QCD including parton
shower using the MC@NLO matching scheme with the dipole shower. As an
example for anomalous couplings, the dimension-8 operator S_1 and
K-matrix unitarization is switched on.


In all cases, Herwig needs to run in three steps:
  Herwig build LHC-Matchbox.in
  Herwig integrate LHC.run
  Herwig run LHC.run
The first part sets up initialization and the second one the integration
grid, the third one produces the actual results. These examples should
run in a reasonable amount of time (few days) on a modern single CPU
core.  Parallelizing the integration and run step and using several
cores or machines can reduce this significantly. See the Herwig manual
for more details, e.g. how to perform a parallel grid optimization.
