This is the folder for h(2*,3*,4) with CP-mixed settings.
Here I divided the event generation in 5 chunks for demonstration purpose.
The chunk setting can reduce the computation time for a single event generation run.
In the actual run, I used 10 chunks.
The input cards should be same in different chunks except Chunk-settings.in file.
